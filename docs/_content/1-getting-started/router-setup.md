# Router Setup

Muxa is build to figure out your routes using the directory. This is done
through following a few rules... Lets get started

## Creating your homepage

In `src/routes` create a file called index.tsx

```tsx
import { useRouteData } from "muxa";

//What ever your default export is, will be your route
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Setting up the router

Since everything we are doing is client side, we have to create a file which
will tell Muxa which routes to use. This is done through a command.

In package.json under scripts add a command:

`"migrate": "muxa typescript"`,

If you are not using typescript then remove that part.

We can then run `npm run migrate` which will create a file for us called
route-config.

In `app.js`

```jsx
import { Router, Document } from "muxa";
// importing the routes that are generated by muxa
import { routes } from "./route-config"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router fallback={<h1>Loading...</h1>}>
      <Document routes={routes}>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

And there we go, we now have our home page running!
